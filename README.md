# GWT Gradle Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jiakuan/gwt-gradle-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jiakuan/gwt-gradle-plugin)

This plugin makes it easy to build projects using [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/). It provides several tasks to support the development and configures several aspects of your project to work with GWT automatically.

It was originally created by Steffen Schaefer. Really appreciate his effort on making this great plugin.

In last two years, there were no updates in the original git repo, so I plan to continue the maintenance in this fork.

For more information, please see the new documentation site I created: [http://gwt-gradle-plugin.documentnode.io](http://gwt-gradle-plugin.documentnode.io)
