# GWT Gradle Plugin

This plugin makes it easy to build projects using [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/). It provides several tasks to support the development and configures several aspects of your project to work with GWT automatically.

Among other things, the plugin provides these features:

* Running the GWT compiler and automatic inclusion of the compiled stuff in your *.war file
* Starting GWT Dev Mode
* Support for Super Dev Mode (GWT 2.5+)
* Configuration of different GWT modules for development and production
* GWT specific configuration of Eclipse projects

# Resources

* [Version history](http://steffenschaefer.github.io/gwt-gradle-plugin/versions.html)
* [Documentation][doc]
* [JavaDocs][javadoc]

# Examples

Several example projects can be found in [/examples](examples).

# Usage

The following example shows the code to set up gwt-gradle-plugin for a GWT web application project using Maven/Gradle standard layout.

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            // Alternatively use:
    //        maven {
	//            url 'http://dl.bintray.com/steffenschaefer/maven'
	//        }
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'org.wisepersist:gwt-gradle-plugin:0.6'
        }
    }

    apply plugin: 'war'
    apply plugin: 'gwt'

    gwt {
        gwtVersion='2.8.1'
        modules '<YOUR-GWT-MODULE>'
    }
    
This will configure your GWT web project to execute the GWT compiler and include the compiler output into your *.war file. The code shown above also configures all GWT core dependencies (gwt-dev, gwt-user, gwt-servlet, ...).

To build the *.war file including your compiled GWT modules, simply call "gradle build".
If you want to start the GWT development mode simply call "gradle gwtDev".
